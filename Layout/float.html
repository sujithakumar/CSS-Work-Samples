        Tom and Jerry is an American comedy slapstick cartoon series created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph
        Barbera. It centers on a rivalry between the title characters Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse. Many episodes also
        feature several recurring characters.

        In its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 Tom and Jerry shorts for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer from 1940 to
        1958.[1] During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with
        Walt Disney's Silly Symphonies with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in
        1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 Tom and Jerry shorts for Rembrandt
        Films from 1961 to 1962. Tom and Jerry then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time,
        overtaking Looney Tunes. Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963
        and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, The Mansion Cat in 2001, The Karate Guard in 2005, and A Fundraising
        Adventure in 2014, making a total of 164 shorts.

        A number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series The Tom and Jerry Show (1975), The Tom and
        Jerry Comedy Show (1980–82), Tom and Jerry Kids (1990–93), Tom and Jerry Tales (2006–08), and The Tom and Jerry
        Show (2014–present). The first feature-length film based on the series, Tom and Jerry: The Movie, was released
        in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002.
